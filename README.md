# Visual C# Step by Step — Learning Repository

This repository contains my **learning exercises and practice projects** based on  
**_Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step_ by John Sharp (Microsoft Press)**.  (6th printing, 2014)

Although the book targets Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4, the core principles remain highly relevant for learning **modern C#** and **object-oriented programming**.

I couldn’t resist picking up a mint-condition copy — still sealed with its original CD — from such a well-respected author whose work remains highly applicable today. 
Completing these exercises first will provide a solid foundation before moving on to the 2022 edition of the book, allowing me to explore how the language and tooling have evolved and to better understand legacy code in context.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:
- Reinforce **C# language fundamentals** through guided exercises  
- Explore **Visual Studio IDE features** and project structure  
- Build practical experience with **Windows desktop apps**, **data access**, and **object-oriented design**  
- Provide a version-controlled archive of my progress through each chapter  

Each chapter introduces new concepts, which are implemented and committed as standalone Visual Studio projects.

## Learning Focus

Through these exercises I’m practicing:
- **Core C# syntax and structure**  
- **OOP principles** (abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism)  
- **Error and exception handling**  
- **Collections, LINQ, and data access**  
- **WPF UI development**  
- **Multithreading and async programming fundamentals**

---

## Environment

While the original book used **Visual Studio 2010** and **.NET Framework 4**,  
I’m completing the exercises using:

- **Visual Studio 2022/2026 Community Editions**  
- **.NET 6 / .NET 8 SDK** (as compatible)  
- **Windows 10**  
- Target framework: `.NET Framework 4.0` or newer equivalents  
<!--
Each project includes a `.csproj` and `Program.cs` (or WPF `MainWindow.xaml.cs`) as appropriate.
-->
