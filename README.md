# Visual C# Step by Step — Learning Repository

This repository contains my **learning exercises and practice projects** based on  
**_Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step_ by John Sharp (Microsoft Press)**.  (6th printing, 2014)

Although the book targets Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4, the core principles remain highly relevant for learning **modern C#** and **object-oriented programming**.

I couldn’t resist picking up a mint-condition copy — still sealed with its original CD — from a well-respected author. 
Completing these exercises will provide a solid foundation and will allow me to explore how the language and tooling have evolved and to better understand legacy code in context.

There is a newer version available: 

*Microsoft Visual C# Step by Step (Developer Reference)*

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:
- Reinforce **C# language fundamentals** through guided exercises  
- Explore **Visual Studio / Visual Studio Community IDE features** and project structure  
- Build practical experience with **Windows desktop apps**, **data access**, and **object-oriented design**  
- Provide a version-controlled archive of my progress through each chapter  

Each chapter introduces new concepts, which are implemented and committed as standalone Visual Studio projects.

## Learning Focus

Through these exercises I’m practicing:
- **Core C# syntax and structure**  
- **OOP principles** (abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism)  
- **Error and exception handling**  
- **Collections, LINQ, and data access**  
- **WPF UI development**  
- **Multithreading and async programming fundamentals**

---

## Environment

While the original book used **Visual Studio 2010** and **.NET Framework 4**,  
I’m completing the exercises using:

- **Visual Studio 2022/2026 Community Editions**  
- **.NET 6 / .NET 8 SDK** (as compatible)  
- **Windows 10**  
- Target framework: `.NET Framework 4.0` or newer equivalents  
<!--
Each project includes a `.csproj` and `Program.cs` (or WPF `MainWindow.xaml.cs`) as appropriate.
